python/progs

README

==============

progs is the location for working programs. It is controlled by the branch 'progs' on the github site,
and this is where that branch should be cloned.

Any tar.gz versions of python downloaded should be unpacked and then moved to a folder python_xx here.

This folder also contains routines such as kpar which python uses.

The original commit of kpar used kpar.121216. Any updated versions will show in commit messages.
