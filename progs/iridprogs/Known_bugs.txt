This file should contain a list of known issues with Python that are 
unresolved. I've tried to go through all the previous Readme files and
collect the details here. They are in no particular order.

***********************************************************************

 -- smoothing of continuum. As discussed with KSL during visit to IC (Jul04)
there are steps in the continuum due to the sampling of the bb function
away from the peak. At the moment this is fixed for YSO calculations by
fudging the shape in the bb low frequency tail by using
"pdf_get_rand_limit_bbir (pdf)" (which is in matom.c) but a more elegant
solution would be a good idea.

 -- some of the edge cells in YSO calculations seem to get very cold.
Reason unknown at the moment. Only affects cells that have boarder with 
disk. Doesn't always happen (depends on wind parameters).

 -- in macro atom versions of the code only topbase style photoionization
x-sections are accounted for. At present any Verner cross-sections for
simple atoms are ignored.

 -- irradiation of disk: at present for YSO models the irradiation of the
disk is accounted for by a fudge factor based on Proga's work (see
disk.c). Only included for model type "7" (YSO). "Hard wired" and not
very elegant.

 -- escape probability: the code uses a mean escape probability - I'm
not sure how crude this might be

 -- there may be something odd about the level of the Lyman continuum in
calculations with macro atoms vs those without: it is higher when macro
atoms are used. Whether this is correct I don't know (it may be).

 -- there may be a problem associated with jumps in pdfs - see !BUG comment
in recomb.c

 -- at times packets seem to find themselves in cells with zero volume in 
calculate_ds which I think they should not (see !BUG comment in resonate.c)

 -- at times "kpkt" is reporting negative cooling rates in bf processes. This 
is impossible (physically) and, as far as I can see, impossible numerically
given how it's computed. I think the problem lies in integrating over the
grid of input cross-section - the problem seems to come when the grid is very
coarse (e.g. one of the common problem continuum is
"PhotTopS  6  2 200    6     1.353440  50"
in which only the first three cross-section points are actually important).
Perhaps some of these sort of continuua need to be removed or a finer grid 
used in the input data. This never seems to be less of a problem when only H 
and or He continuua are used than when CNO are included, but at least one of 
the He I continuua has this problem too.

04jul--ksl--It's possilble that one should use a finer grid, but that should
not cause the problem.  I expect the inexactness of the integrals is more
likely to be the problem.  I modified alpha_ap so that insted of calculating
two integrals, one only calculates one.  In this case the integrand is always
positive, and the problem disappeared. See notes in matom.c

-- CV models run much more slowly than YSO models. Probably related to the
density and perhaps the processing of k-packets. I should try to speed this
up soon. Reducing the number of bf continuua used in the calculation would 
be a big help.


-- there was a bug on line 267 of util.c (used MDIM rather than NDIM). Fixed 
for now but am noting this since we want to remove 1-D references where 
possible.
