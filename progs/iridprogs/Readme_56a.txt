The main point of this effort is to properly include a verticall extended disk

What is w[].xcen used for?

gradv.c -- used as the vasic lace for calculating the gradient
py_wind.c -- used in one place to report position summary
resonate.c -- used in kpf_need
wind2d.c  -- used as the place where the variables that are x
wind.c -- found in wind_check.  All that is done is to check that the values are "sane"

and all of the variable coordinate routines themselves
