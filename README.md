README, structure branch
=========

###Directory Structure

This is a directory structure for Python, the radiative transfer code
developed by Knox Long, Christian Knigge, Nick Higginbottom and Stuart Sim.  This
structure is supposed to allow for development as well as running Python.

Versions as far back as 58 are archived on GitHub, and older versions of the software are should be/are largely archived 
on the central store at

/user/long/archive_progs/Python_archive

To install python on a new machine, one should first copy the entire
directory structure.  This simplest way to do this 

You can download the required structure under the structure branch. e.g.
$ git clone https://github.com/agnwinds/python.git -b structure
or simply click on the 'zip' button with the structure branch selected.!

Releases of progs can be found under [tags](https://github.com/agnwinds/python/tags "Wiki").

Consult the [wiki](https://github.com/agnwinds/python/wiki/_pages "Wiki") for how to install Python.

You will also have to install cfitsio and gsl- instructions on doing this are also in the wiki.
