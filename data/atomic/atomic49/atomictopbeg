# This is a data file which can be used to input atomic data
# The first word defines the type of record.  The data which follows
# Element and Ion refers to that element and ion until the next element
# or ion is begun.  Continuation lines may be indicated by * in the first
# word in the line. 

# Lines beginning with # will be regarded as comments.

# If a line is blank it will be ignored.
# The order of the inputs can sometimes be important. In particular, A
# should be the first line for any element and Ion should be the first line
# for any ion
# 

# For elements, the format is
#Element  z   name  log abun (by number)
Element 1	H	12.00
Element	2	He	10.93
Element	6	C	8.52
Element	7	N	7.96
Element	8	0	8.82

Element	10	Ne	7.92
Element 11  Na  6.25
Element 12  Mg  7.42
Element	13	Al	6.39
Element	14	Si	7.52
# Element	15	P	5.52
Element	16	S	7.20
Element 18  Ar  6.8
Element 20  Ca  6.30
Element	26	Fe	7.60
Element 28  Ni  6.30

#For ions, the format is
# Ion  Element   z ionization State  g IP(in eV)
# However, the element name is not saved, indexing is based on z and istate
# Levels if they exist have the format
# Level Principle q #  g  excitation energy
