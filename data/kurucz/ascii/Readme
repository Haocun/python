This directory contains Kurucz models from the new Kurucz model tape.
The files are indexed in kurucz_index

The index file can be created from the data files as follows

ls f*.dat >foo
awk -f kindex.awk <foo >foo1
sort -n +1 < foo1 > kurucz_index
rm foo foo1

This will produce a file with the filenames and the temperatures and gravities.
There are a few extraneous files so one has to look at the produced file
and remove them.


Note: The Kurucz models as read from the tape do not all have the same
number of wavelengths.  Red stars do not have the most ultraviolet wavelengths.OIt looks as if blue stars have the most wavelengths.  The wavelengths that
they do have are the same.
