04aug -- ksl -- This directory contains the kurucz models in an ascii format that is suitable for use
with python52 and beyond.  It should be the same as the data that is contained in binary form
in data.91.  kurucz91.ls is the file that must be read into python and other programs like kslfit.
The basic files were created with ascii_expand from the original ascii files (in Kurucz's format).
The units are converted to be identical those calculated with Tlusty/Synspec, e.g ergs/cm**2/s/A,
and the normalization should be identical.
