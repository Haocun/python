This directory contains the programs and procedures need to recreate 
the binary directories for the Kurucz files.   It is needed in situations
in which the binary format of a computer differs from that of my primary system,
e.g. a SUN.  I used it when I began using PC-based linux in 1999  I did test
this and it did seem to work (ksl)

My programs assume that the kurucz directory will have a structure
kurucz/ascii  : the repository for the ascii files which were the original data
 Tar this from the kurucz/ascii directory on pisces.
kurucz/data.91: the repository for the binary files

To create the binary files one needs to recompile kuruczwrite after having
modify the directory names appropriately.

The one should be able to execute the command runit which will cause 
kuruczwrite to create the individual binary files.

Copy the file kurucz_index (in this directory) data.91 (or recreate it from 
the awkscript kindex.  (Note I have no tried to determine exactly how this
awkscript was run since I had the file kindex already.
