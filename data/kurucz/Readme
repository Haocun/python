These are the kurucz data files.  It is important to know that the binary
files in data.91 for linux are not identical to those on the Sun.  
One must run the routines Make_binary (which can be found on the Sun).

00 -- I have retrieved new kurucz files from Bob Kurucz's web site, and
written a program dump_kurucz to put his single file, into file formats
that should work with kslfit.  Note that these files will not work with
specfit because it calculates the wavelength differences from the first
two bins.

01jan02 -- This version is the version of these directories created on 
walleye on this date.  It includes the updates from Pike in late December.

04aug -- I want to eliminate the need to use binary files from any of my 
porgrams, especially Python.  However, many of my programs, including 
python assume that a list of ascii model files all have the same wavelength
scale.  The Kurucz models used a fixed set of wavelengths but do not
report all of the wavelengths that are contained in the grid.  My binary
writing routines took this into account.
